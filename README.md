# Task 4: Aggregate Functions and Grouping

## Objective
The objective of Task 4 is to learn how to use aggregate functions and grouping techniques in SQL to summarize and analyze data from relational tables.

## Tools Used
- DB Browser for SQLite
- MySQL Workbench

## Task Description
In this task, we practiced writing SQL queries that use:
- **Aggregate functions** such as `SUM`, `COUNT`, and `AVG` to perform calculations on grouped data
- **GROUP BY** to group rows based on specific columns (e.g., by category, customer, or order)
- **HAVING** to filter the results after grouping (similar to WHERE but used with aggregates)

These queries help to:
- Calculate totals and averages
- Count records in groups
- Identify patterns and insights across multiple rows

## Outcome
By completing Task 4, we gained the ability to:
- Summarize large sets of data using aggregate functions
- Categorize and group data meaningfully using `GROUP BY`
- Apply conditions to grouped data using `HAVING`

This task helps in understanding how to generate summary reports from database tables.
